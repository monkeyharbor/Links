{"name":"Zara","content":"it is legitimate for critical social theory to dream of a world without advertising of the sort that litters contemporary capitalism. In a rational society, information would be made readily available to individuals through data bases concerning any product that might wish to buy. A computerized information system would thus eliminate the need for advertising. In a democratic society, individuals would freely determine their needs and desires and would resist being molded by institutions which mainly wish to manipulate and exploit them. Image production would be so diverse, so inventive, and so exciting that advertising would lose its allure and seductive power and might well wither away. And in a world without advertising perhaps individuals could finally attempt to discover and determine what they really wanted to be and to discern for themselves what kind of a world they wanted.","_id":"J0KqNKUmd7LSZgW9"}

If he will just come back once and kiss me on the face his coarse hair brush my temple, it’s throbbing!  then I can put on my clothes I guess, and walk the streets.  2 I love you. I love you, but I’m turning to my verses and my heart is closing like a fist.  Words! be sick as I am sick, swoon, roll back your eyes, a pool,  and I’ll stare down at my wounded beauty which at best is only a talent for poetry.  Cannot please, cannot charm or win what a poet! and the clear water is thick  with bloody blows on its head. I embrace a cloud, but when I soared it rained.  3 That’s funny! there’s blood on my chest oh yes, I’ve been carrying bricks what a funny place to rupture! and now it is raining on the ailanthus as I step out onto the window ledge the tracks below me are smoky and glistening with a passion for running I leap into the leaves, green like the sea","address":"200 EAST 71 STREET","_id":"zIX3gZCT10D0SQiA"}
