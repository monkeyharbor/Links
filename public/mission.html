        <p> LinkNYC kiosks were presented as 21st-century utilitarian stations that would grease the wheels of city life as phone booths once did. They offered free phone calls within the U.S., wif-fi, device charging, and directions.</p>
        
        <p> What arrived on our streets were monoliths that function as digital advertising billboards, data collection apparati, and potential surveillance systems.</p>
        
        <p>About 1,800 Links of the 7,500 promised Links have been installed in NYC. Most of them are located in Manhattan where wi-fi access is prevalent, but selling ads is easier. Many of the city's poorest areas have few kiosks or none at all.</p>
        
        <p>The makers of the Links, in their techno-capitalist myopia, overlooked who would become the primary user of the Link: our neighbors who are without homes.</p> 
        
        <p>Many of these neighbors lack smartphones, computers, and access to the Internet and entertainment. Some built encampments at the Links, their light and structure acting as a kind of techno-hearth. For those of us without a home, what is private is made public. And so, with the initially unrestricted Internet access, many users utilized the Links for entertainment. </p>
        
        <p>This led to an outcry as the unintended users of Link towers and their actions were visually offensive to the middle class. Web-browsing was suspended. The public sphere was secured again for the sake of advertising and consumerism, this time with a technologically advanced apparatus, one that could easily be used to surveil the public 24/7.</p>  
        
        <p><b>Let us dream of a world without advertising and surveillance of the sort that litters our public spaces under contemporary capitalism. </b> What should the Links be used for and whom should they serve?
