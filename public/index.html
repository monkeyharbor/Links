            <div id="intro-text">
                <p> Welcome to the Link LIberation Front of NYC

                    Links were presented as 21st century utilitarian stations that would grease the wheels of city life as phone booths and newsstands once did. With the offer of a free Wi-Fi network and free calling, these monoliths function as digital advertising billboards, data collection technology, and potential surveillance systems. 
                    
                    About 1,800 Links of the 7,500 promised kiosks have been installed in NYC. 
                    
                    They are mostly in Manhattan where access to wi-fi is not as critical as in other areas, but where selling ads is easier! Many of the city’s poorest areas have few kiosks, or none at all.
                    
                    The LinkNYC kiosks were developed by the CityBridge consortium “linked” to Google. The project estimated $500 million in revenue for the city via advertising on the 55-inch screens. 
                    
                    The makers of the Links, in their techno-capitalist myopia, overlooked who would become the primary user of the Link: our neighbors who are without homes.  
                    
                    Many of these neighbors lack smartphones, computers, and entertainment. Some built encampments at the Links, their light and structure acting as a sort of street side hearth. With the originally unrestricted Internet access, some began to engage in forms of entertainment that others only did in the privacy of their homes. 
                    
                    For those of us without a home, what is normally private is made public. So, indulgence in the endless streams of porn to be found on the Internet became a common pastime on the Links. 
                    
                    This, of course, offended the sensibilities of the Link’s intended users, the middle class, and in 2016 web-browsing was suspended. The public sphere was co-opted once again for the sake of advertising and consumerism, this time with a technologically advanced apparatus, one that could easily be used to surveil the public 24/7. 
                    
                    
                    The Links co-opt public space for the purposes of advertising.
                    
                    The Links are equipped with highly advanced surveillance technology. 
                    
                    The Links violate our privacy and collect our data. 
                    
                    The Links restrict Internet access to prevent people from using the Links for their individual purposes.
                    
                    Will Links be the cornerstone of an all encompassing surveillance state? Or will we, the people, creatively intervene and use the Link as a tool to help build the future that we want? 
                    
                    Let us dream of a world without advertising of the sort that litters contemporary capitalism and our public spaces. 
                    
                    Will the future continue in our society's tendency to shut out the already marginalized? Will it fill every space of our public life with advertising?  How can Links serve their neighborhoods and all neighbors better?
