<b>Link Liberation Front (LLF)</b><br>

<b>About</b><br>
This project critiques LinkNYC kiosks that replaced phone booths throughout NYC. Links allow free phone calls and wi-fi access, but they are also digital advertising billboards, data collection apparati, and potential surveillance systems.
 
<p>The goal of the Link Liberation Front is the exchange of ideas among those interested in proposing ways of reclaiming the Links. Ideas could address public oversight, the removal of advertisements and surveillance/data collection.</p>

<p>It is important to see Links in relation to their neighborhoods and propose location-tied interventions. Therefore, I used a map to structure location-specific discussion spaces.</p>
 
<p>LLF urges us to re-imagine the Links, and participate in grassroots activism by publicly authoring ideas. The hope is that by interrogating LinkNYC dynamics and policies, communities will have a say in how public spaces are used.</p>

<b>Set up</b><br>
Run npm install to load node packages.
 
<b>Development</b><br>
The project uses the Node.JS web framework Express, and NeDB to store user input. GeoJSON data populates a map built with Leaflet and MapBox GL.
